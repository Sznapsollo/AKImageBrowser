# AKImageBrowser

## About

AKImageBrowser is quick deployable web image browser/gallery that will display images from given folder. It bases on php (backend side) and angular (frontend side).

Working example: <a href="http://cultrides.com/test/Github/AKImageBrowser/" target="_blank">AKIMageBrowser example</a>

## Usage

The idea is to copy contents of AKImageBrowser to some webserver folder that contains images. Then open this folder address in webbrowser which will allow to browse these images in a bit more friendly manner.

AKImageBrowser has some features that make image browsing a bit more pleasant:
- paging with options to choose how many images per page should be displayed
- lazy loading -> images will load when user actually displays them
- filtering of image types -> user can set what type of file extensions should be displayed [in options]
- image scaling -> user can adjust size of images to be displayed in gallery. [in options]

## Note

This little tool comes in handy sometimes. I made it just to have easily deployable image browser with friendly interface for variety of needs (home camera images, vacation pics etc). Hope you will find it useful too ;-)
